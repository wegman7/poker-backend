backlog:
- set up logging correctly
- set up env vars with all secrets
- clean up auth0_util.py with only things that we need
- make hiding opponents cards more efficient (using deepcopy currently)




- need to fix issue of sending out state everytime someone connects
- also need to figure out how we want to handle closing engine when players no longer connected - should be some sort of timeout
- add automatic refreshing of tokens
